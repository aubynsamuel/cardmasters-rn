# Card Game Rules

## Setup

- _Cards_: Use 6 through 10, Jack, Queen, and King of each suit (diamonds, spades, hearts, clubs)
- _Deal_:
  - Shuffle the deck
  - Deal 3 cards to each player clockwise, starting with the player to the right of the dealer
  - Then deal 2 more cards to each player in the same direction (total of 5 cards per player)
  - Players cannot see each other's cards

## Gameplay

1. _First Turn_: The player who received the first card begins
2. _Control_: The player in control plays any card from their hand
3. _Following Turns_: Moving clockwise, each player must:
   - Play a card of the same suit if they have one
   - Play any card if they don't have the called suit
4. _Gaining Control_: If a player plays a card of the called suit that is higher than any previous card of that suit in the trick, they gain control
5. _Winning_: After all 5 cards the player in control is the winner

## Important

- Players must play a card of the called suit if they have one (no holding back)
- If a player is caught hiding a card of the called suit, they are disqualified
- Strategy involves saving higher cards for later tricks when possible

## Next Round

- If enough cards remain to deal 5 cards to each player, deal again starting with the player to the right of the new dealer which is the winner of the previous game.
- If fewer than 10 cards remain (or not enough to give each player 5), reshuffle the entire deck and start a new game
